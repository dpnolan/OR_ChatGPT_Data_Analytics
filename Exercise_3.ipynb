This could potentially be achieved through better internal architecture, enhanced ventilation, use of heat resistant materials or even integrating a more advanced cooling technology.\\n\\n3. Provide Guidance on Proper Usage: Given these concerns, creating detailed user guidelines on how to optimize device use could prevent overheating and prolong battery life. This could include tips such as not using certain power-draining applications continuously, not exposing the device to direct sunlight for prolonged periods, or maybe even suggesting accessories that help dissipate heat. Providing such assistance can ensure the product's longevity while improving the overall customer experience.\""

Issues with our pricing policy, specifically regarding price reductions shortly after purchase, are resulting in customer disappointment. Additionally, customers are still waiting for deliveries despite ordering two weeks prior, indicating a potential problem with our shipping or order management process.\\n\\nAreas for Improvement: We may need to revisit the engineering of our devices to address issues around battery life and heat dissipation. The possibility of implementing a price guarantee policy to ensure customer satisfaction after a short-term price drop could be considered. Our logistics and delivery processes should be evaluated to ensure on-time deliveries.
